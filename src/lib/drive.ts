/** Uploading to a Google shared drive, as the service account.
 *
 *  ## Why a service account rather than the person
 *
 *  The file goes to a shared drive the business already uses (owner,
 *  2026-09-21: *pakai folder ops di tiap module shared drive*), and the reason
 *  it goes there rather than somewhere of the application's own is that people
 *  open these files by hand, in Drive, beside the work. A per-user OAuth flow
 *  would put every upload behind a Google consent screen and make the app's
 *  ability to file depend on whether the person signing in happens to have a
 *  Workspace account — which B5 deliberately does not require.
 *
 *  So one identity writes: `capture-worker@…`, a Content manager on each drive.
 *  It has been doing exactly this for the legacy system since it began.
 *
 *  ## Why this is not in the browser
 *
 *  A service account key in a browser is a service account key in everybody's
 *  browser. This module is `server-only` and the route that uses it runs in the
 *  Worker; the key reaches it as a runtime secret and never as `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
 *  `credentials()` refuses the prefixed form outright rather than reading it,
 *  the same way `serviceRoleKey()` does, because by the time somebody notices
 *  the name the value has already shipped.
 *
 *  ## No SDK
 *
 *  `googleapis` is a large dependency that assumes Node's crypto and HTTP.
 *  What is needed here is one signed JWT and two `fetch` calls, and WebCrypto
 *  does RS256 natively — so this is about eighty lines instead of a megabyte,
 *  and it runs on the Worker runtime without a shim.
