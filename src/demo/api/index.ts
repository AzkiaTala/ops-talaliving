/** The service clients, as screens see them.
 *
 *  A screen imports from here and never from `../store`. Which implementation
 *  it gets is decided here and nowhere else: `swap()` returns the demo module
 *  in demo mode, and in live mode the real client from `src/lib/api` with a 501
 *  standing in for every function that has no database behind it yet.
 *
 *  That is the swap `ADR-009` and `src/lib/api/index.ts` both describe, and the
 *  reason it is one file rather than fifty-two is unchanged: fifty-two edits are
 *  fifty-two chances to convert one screen and forget another, and a half-swapped
 *  app is one where two screens disagree about the same number with no visible
 *  reason.
 *
 *  **Demo mode survives.** `src/demo` is not deleted by this: it is the guided
 *  tour, the offline sandbox, and the only place `actAs` can exist — impersonation
 *  against a real database is not a feature with a guard missing, it is the
 *  absence of authentication.
